Minimum cost flow using network simplex method

This is an old school project that I decided to upload for safe keeping.

## Minimum Cost Flow without Upper and Lower Bounds
Implemented the network simplex method for unbounded minimum cost flow problems
Tested on 3 small and 1 medium size networks
Many of the larger problems were in a custom format and I did not have the time to test them
Output either validated from source or by constructed solution
Troubled development would indicate that this program is not robust
  Many manual edge case checks
  Not nearly as well planned, organized, or executed as my GA program  
Tedious input method
